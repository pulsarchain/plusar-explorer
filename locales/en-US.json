We have delved into the underlying technologies of blockchain for many years, always looking for a fairer and more lasting way of community governance and working for it. We don't want thrilling, we want to stand on the shoulders of giants and make changes. We don't want to live in the real world. We just want to live in the chain.

As long as you are a member of the blockchain world, you can easily get PUL, PUL will be not worth a cent if out of PULSAR, perhaps collection is the main role. Refuse any so-called private placement, financing, or responsibility for any related event. PUL is the GAS of the PULSAR chain. Its value is to burn itself and light others.

To educate others, someone will always do it. We have no ability to educate others but to control ourselves. PULSAR ecology is a broad enough road, and we will overcome",
